You found Stephen Wood's little home page.

I'm a backend engineer currently living in San Jose. My language du jour is
python, though I have found a growing fascination with Google's Go language.

I also greatly enjoy linux automation and making micro services that run inside
linux containers, such as docker. This little website itself is a container that
is deployed via Elastic Beanstalk. <a href="https://github.com/stephen-mw/webby_docker">Here</a>'s the code :)

I don't believe Docker is a silver bullet, but lxc (linux containers) have proven
themselves to be extremely valuable and worth using. Docker as a service makes
using lxc a breeze.

Most of the interesting things I produce can be found on my <a href="http://heystephenwood.com">blog</a> or <a href="https://github.com/stephen-mw">Github page</a>.

Find me on the web:

- <a href="https://github.com/stephen-mw">Stephen Wood's github page</a>
- <a href="http://www.heystephenwood.com">Stephen Wood's blog</a>

There's enough there to get a good stalking profile going.
