You found Stephen Wood's little home page.

I'm a software engineer currently living in San Jose. My language du jour is
python, though I have found a growing fascination with Google's Go language.

I also greatly enjoy linux automation and making micro services that run inside
linux containers, such as docker.

Most of the interesting things I produce can be found on my <a href="http://heystephenwood.com">blog</a> or <a href="https://github.com/stephen-mw">Github page</a>.

Find me on the web:

- <a href="https://github.com/stephen-mw">Stephen Wood's github page</a>
- <a href="http://www.heystephenwood.com">Stephen Wood's blog</a>

There's enough there to get a good stalking profile going.

If you want to class up your cat you should check out my wife's <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/114763202/bow-tie-cat-collar-various-prints-19?ref=related-0">cat bowtie</a> selection.
